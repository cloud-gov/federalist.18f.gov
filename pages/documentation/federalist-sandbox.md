## Getting started:

If you're interested in seeing how Federalist works for yourself, [let us know]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/), and we can create a sandbox environment for your team.

It's important to try a tool before committing to using it, and with Federalist, we give you the power to do just that before having to do any paperwork.

We understand that signing agreements in the federal government can be slow, but you can to start building the site in our sandbox environment and be ready to launch to production as soon as the agreement is signed.

## Ready to launch:

If the Federalist sandbox environment proves useful, our team will work with you through the necessary the IAA process. In the meantime, you are more than welcome to continue using the sandbox environment in staging.

Once an IAA is signed, this is your green light to launch your site to the public. Per compliance, we cannot allow websites to be published to a production state until the necessary documents are signed and ready to go. However, we do encourage you to create and build whatever you’d like in the sandbox.
