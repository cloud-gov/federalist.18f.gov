Hello World

The <b>21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA)</b> aims to improve the digital experience for government customers and reinforces existing requirements for federal public websites. Specifically, the Act requires all executive branch agencies to:

- modernize their websites,
- digitize services and forms,
- accelerate use of e-signatures,
- improve customer experience, and
- standardize and transition to centralized shared services.

All new, public-facing websites and digital services must meet eight specific requirements:

1. **Accessible** - be accessible to individuals with disabilities in accordance with Section 508
2. **Consistent** - have a consistent appearance
3. **Authoritative** - not overlap with or duplicate existing websites
4. **Searchable** - contain a search function
5. **Secure** - be provided through a secure connection
6. **User-centered** - be designed around user needs with data-driven analysis
7. **Customizable** - provide an option for a more customized digital experience
8. **Mobile-friendly** - be functional and usable on mobile devices
