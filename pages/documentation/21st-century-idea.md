All new, public-facing websites and digital services should meet eight specific requirements.

1. **Accessible** - be accessible to individuals with disabilities in  accordance with Section 508
1. **Consistent** - have a consistent appearance
1. **Authoritative** - not overlap with or duplicate existing websites
1. **Searchable** - contain a search function
1. **Secure** - be provided through a secure connection
