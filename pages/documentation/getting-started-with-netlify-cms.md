Federalist recently integrated support for Netlify CMS, an open source content management system for your Git workflow that provides editors with a friendly UI and intuitive workflows.

### Building a new site from template
Netlify CMS functionality is now built into the base Federalist Jekyll and Gatsby templates. To begin utilizing, just select the [template]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/templates/) that you wish to use as your base site and you'll be ready to edit your site once the initial build and deployment are complete.

### Adding Netlify CMS to existing site
If your site is already up and running, please follow the instructions on [Netlify's Add To Your Site](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/) page to add Netlify CMS. Please pay particular attention to the location of the admin folder depending on your static site generator.

Jekyll:
/admin/config.yml

Gatsby or Hugo:
/static/admin/config.yml
