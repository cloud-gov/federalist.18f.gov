title: How Federalist Works
---
## Open source

Federalist is a hosted service run by [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) for use by US federal government agencies. The software behind this service is open source and released to the public domain for anyone to use. We also welcome your contributions.

We use GitHub to manage our work on Federalist. The main code repository for the Federalist website and API is at [https://github.com/18F/federalist](https://github.com/18F/federalist). In addition to hosting code, we use the issue queue on this repository to manage our development tasks and milestones. The wiki contains our internal documentation for how we develop and operate the service. If you're interested in getting involved with this project, please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/18F/federalist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Other components of the Federalist service are available in separate repositories:

* **[federalist-builder**](https://github.com/18F/federalist-builder) This application is used to launch build tasks for Federalist in an AWS ECS Docker container based on messages from an AWS SQS queue

* **[federalist-docker-build**](https://github.com/18F/federalist-docker-build) A Docker image that runs Jekyll to build a site

* **[docker-ruby-ubuntu**](https://github.com/18F/docker-ruby-ubuntu) A base image for Docker

* **[federalist-modern-team-template**](https://github.com/18F/federalist-modern-team-template) This is a Jekyll site. It is a simple site to showcase the work of an organization with a few different page types.

* **[federalist-docs**](https://github.com/18F/federalist-docs) This documentation website

### Site Editors

Users manage content with a web- based editor

* federalist.18f.gov

### https://federalist.18f.gov

Main application server providing an API and front-end website load balanced across at least two instances

Build messages generated by the API are sent to the SQS queue

* GH: 18f/federalist

* CF: -o federalist -s prod -n federalist

* Federalist API: /\*

* Federalist front-end: /assets/\*

### GitHub

Changes from the editor are committed to repositories

Commits POST webhook PUSH events to the API

### federalist-database

General application database for the API

* rds shared-psql

### federalist-redis

Session store for user sessions

* redis28 standard

### Simple Queue Service (SQS)

Message queue for handling build requests

* federalist-builds

### https://federalist-builder.18f.gov

Processes build requests from a queue and launches build tasks

Polls the queue for build messages

Message is deleted after a task is initiated

* GH: 18f/federalist-builder

* CF: -o federalist -s prod -n federalist-builder

### Elastic Container Service (ECS)

Runs docker container tasks on EC2s specified in the Cloud Formation template

After receiving a build message, initiate an ECS task

Build status sent back to API over HTTP POST

Static assets synced to S3 using the AWS CLI

* GH: 18f/federalist-docker-build

* ECS cluster: default

* ECS task definition: federalist-builder

* Cloud Formation: EC2ContainerService-default

* EC2 instance

  * Docker image

### Simple Storage Service (S3)

Website bucket for hosting generated static website files

* federalist.18f.gov

* main builds: /site/\*

* previews: /preview/\*

### Public Internet

Sites are publicly available as part of an S3 website bucket.

CloudFront is used for custom domains.
