      Vote.gov makes it easier for eligible voters to participate in our
      democratic process by providing streamlined information on how to vote.
      Visitors can register electronically in states that allow it, and download
      a printable application in multiple languages for those states where
      electronic registration isn't an option. Vote.gov was ranked as the <a
      href="/assets/documents/2017-benchmarking-us-government-websites.pdf">#1
      federal website in 2017</a> by the Information Technology &amp; Innovation
      Foundation for meeting basic standards in security, speed, mobile
      friendliness, and accessibility.

      The Department of the Interior's Natural Resources Revenue site provides
      data about how the government manages federal energy and mineral
      resources, revenue, and disbursements. The website delivers valuable data
      to policy experts, while also ensuring the general public can follow along
      through an intuitive user interface and contextual information. This is an
      excellent example of how Federalist can be used to manage complex data
      sets and visualizations. You can learn more about <a

      The Department of Education uses Federalist to host College Scorecard, a
      website that provides users with important information on everything from
      financial aid to expected earnings. College Scorecard demonstrates the
      power of Federalist when used together with <a
      href="http://cloud.gov">cloud.gov</a> for a API-backed database. 
      Federalist's cloud infrastructure helps manage site traffic during spikes
      in visitors, making sure College Scorecard is always available.

      In 2017, the Secretary of the Air Force established AFWERX — a technology
      accelerator that brings the best from academia and industry together to
      solve problems and enhance the Air Force's effectiveness.<br/>A military
      website needs military compliance, and Federalist made it easy for AFWERX
      to get there. Because it's fully customizable, AFWERX could design a brand
      that would attract the cutting-edge contributors they were looking for.
      And because it's FedRAMP-authorized, they could launch their site knowing
      their security met the standards the Department of Defense demands.

      GSA's Centers of Excellence (CoE) program accelerates the modernization of
      IT infrastructure across government. But in early 2018, the CoE team was
      in need of their own modernization: their website was cumbersome, required
      vendors for updates, and took 30-45 minutes to make a single
      change.<br/>With Federalist, CoEs can make their own changes — no outside
      help needed — in five minutes or less. Because everything's organized in
      one place, maintaining their website is simple, efficient, and easily
      managed by in-house staff. And thanks to Federalist's modern, accessible
      templates, this signature White House initiative is now fully compliant
      with the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA).

      The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a
      government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security
      assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products
      and services. FedRAMP's choice to use Federalist for its main website
      speaks to the security and reliability of the Federalist infrastructure.
