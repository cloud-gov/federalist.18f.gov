      a printable application in multiple languages for those states where
      electronic registration isn't an option. Vote.gov was ranked as the <a

  - title: AFWERX
    summary: In 2017, the Secretary of the Air Force established AFWERX — a
      technology accelerator that brings the best from academia and industry
      together to solve problems and enhance the Air Force's
      effectiveness.<br/>A military website needs military compliance, and
      Federalist made it easy for AFWERX to get there. Because it's fully
      customizable, AFWERX could design a brand that would attract the
      cutting-edge contributors they were looking for. And because it's
      FedRAMP-authorized, they could launch their site knowing their security
      met the standards the Department of Defense demands.

  - title: Centers of Excellence
    summary: "\"GSA's Centers of Excellence (CoE) program accelerates the
      modernization of IT infrastructure across government. But in early 2018,
      the CoE team was in need of their own modernization: their website was
      cumbersome, required vendors for updates, and took 30-45 minutes to make a
      single change.<br/>With Federalist, CoEs can make their own changes — no
      outside help needed — in five minutes or less. Because everything's
      organized in one place, maintaining their website is simple, efficient,
      and easily managed by in-house staff. And thanks to Federalist's modern,
      accessible templates, this signature White House initiative is now fully
      compliant with the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act
      (IDEA).\""

  - title: FedRAMP
    summary: The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a
      government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security
      assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products
      and services. FedRAMP's choice to use Federalist for its main website
      speaks to the security and reliability of the Federalist infrastructure.
